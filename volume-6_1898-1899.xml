            month today that we sailed from <placeName ref= "New_York">New York</placeName>, again on the <name type="boat" ref="Kaiser_Wilhem_II"></name>. The voyage was
            a slow and very tiresome one. The weather warm, grey and showery. We reached <placeName ref= "Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName>
            the evening of <date>Monday the 21st</date> about 8 o’clock – and lost that ever interesting sight of
            the approach of the big rock. A fleet of seven English war vessels were in harbour, and
            would have made a pretty spectacle by daylight. Got away at 10 o’clock, and reached
            Naples too late on the evening of the <date>24th</date> to land – although every one was packed and
            ready to get off. The disappointment was all the greater. We passed the usual night of
            din and turmoil, incident to coaling, and landed at 8 o’clock the next morning, finding
            <persName ref="#Andersen">Andersen</persName> and <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary Buttles</persName> waiting for us. A day and night at the Grand Hotel, and off on
            Saturday in the very comfortable <name type= "boat" ref="Regina_Margherita">"Regina Margherita"</name> for <placeName ref= "Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> which we reached on
            Tuesday morning at 9 o’clock and <placeName ref= "Cairo">Cairo</placeName> in the evening. <persName ref= "Parsons_Lellie">Mrs. Edwin Parsons</persName>(Lellie
            Swayne) with two nieces came out with us from <placeName ref= "New_York">New York</placeName>, and has engaged the dahabeah<name type= "boat" ref="Sol el-Nil">Sol
            el-Nil</name>, commonly known as the Hungarian dahabeah, and our faithful old <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Salah</persName> and we all
            started together this morning, and will keep together. She is delighted with everything
            and so is <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie Whaling</persName> whom we brought for the winter. There is the usual crowd at
            <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName>, thinner perhaps as we are nearly two weeks earlier than usual. <geogName ref="The_Nile">The Nile</geogName> is very
            high this year – and we have just <pb n="002"/> escaped a week of rain which they have had
            here, and which has filled <placeName ref="Cairo">Cairo</placeName> with mosquitos. And right glad I was to escape
            Shepheards, and constant combats with mosquitos, and come to our own home on this
            beautiful Bedouin. She has never been in such perfect order – or so pretty and
            comfortable – and peace and repose are again descending upon me.</p></div> 
			
			<div xml:id="EBA18981213" type="Entry"><p><title>Bedrescheyn. Dec. 13.
            Tuesday.</title></p> <p>Everyone went out to Saqqara this morning except <persName ref="#Parsons_Lellie">Lellie Parsons</persName> and myself.
            About 4 o’clock it began to look rather threatening – and in a few moments the rain came
            in torrents. I never saw it rain more furiously for a little while. Great excitement on
            the boat – all hands gathering the bread that was drying on deck into safe quarters. I
            had to take refuge below, while the deck was quickly dismantled and everything put under
            canvass. I was uncomfortable about our people – as I saw the Cook party from the <name type="boat" ref="Ramesis">Ramesis</name>
            arriving in bedraggled condition. But they came home dry, having taken refuge under
            cover. It has rained at intervals since – is warm- the cloud scenery after the heavy
            storm was wonderful. Our boat did not leak in the slightest degree.</p></div>

			<p><title>Wednesday, Dec. 14.</title></p>
            <p>Beautiful weather, but no wind until about 4 o’clock, when we started and made a mile or

            half a mile, but <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> thinks this such a waste of time and strength, that he does
            not often permit it. We are still in sight of Helouan – and the Saqqara pyramids.</p>

			<p><title>Saturday, Dec. 17.</title></p><p>We all took a walk into the town on the railroad this morning to post
            some letters. Our way was by the pleasant palm forest – along the canal, and the
            picturesque, but vilely smelling mud town. A charming country about – still no wind –
            but rather promising signs in the sky this evening.</p></div>

            finely, and we had a glorious run, bringing up here at 4 o’clock. <name type= "boat" ref="The_Lul_el_Nil">The Lul el Nil</name>, came
            along an hour after – and tomorrow we will all go by rail to the Fayum – returning the
            same day. This will not of course give us time to see much. But the Greek Inn at the
            Medina is impossible, and we could not see our way to doing the whole thing, much as we
            would like to see it, as we should be obliged to carry a camp outfit and spend three or
            four days there. High wind tonight and we are rolling a good deal. </p><pb n="004"/>

			<p><title>Monday, Dec.
            19.</title></p> <p> Started for <placeName ref="El_Medina">El Medina</name>, <placeName ref="Fayum">Fayum</name> by rail at 10:30, Parson included – and folted in
            fairly comfortable fashion across the desert to <placeNAme ref="Medina">Medina</name> which we reached at 12 o’clock –
            and had an excellent luncheon at the Hotel du Fayoum – where one could be very
            comfortable for a few days and see the district thoroughly. Then we had 3 carriages! and
            drove about through the town and environs. The town is quite European, is of much
            importance, 40,000 inhabitants – and the great canal, <geogName ref="The Bahr Jusuf Canal">the Bahr Jusuf</grogName> which leaves the
            Nile near <placeName ref="Assuit">Assiut</name> and flows to the <placeName ref="Fayum">Fayoum</name> gives extraordinary fertility to this district.
            Its many branches flowing through the town, and the numerous bridges we crossed gave
            many novel features – making a kind of Egyptian <placeName ref="Venice">Venice</name> or <placeName ref="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</name>. Very good streets,
            with handsome buildings, and gardens – most interesting. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> made the acquaintance
            of an unknown Englishman who has lived there for 10 years – and he says one can drive
            quite comfortably to the pyramids of Hawara and Illahun. Home by 5 o’clock tired and
            glad. Fine evening effects returning across the desert. The Meydum pyramid touched to
            radiance by the setting sun, while all about was grey and dark.</p></div>

			<p><title>Tuesday, Dec. 20.</title></p> <p>Very
            heavy fog this morning – and no wind until 11 o’clock – very shifting all day – with
            heavy clouds about late in the afternoon, and some lightning and a little rain. Made
            about 6 miles. I had one charming hour on deck just after lunch, while we were anchored
            in a <pn n="005"/> dead calm. Water like glass – the delicate colouring of that hour of the day
            – the utter stillness only emphasised by a boat descending the other side of the wide
            river, with its boatmen crooning and singing. What heavenly repose!</p></div>

            <p>A cool morning and but little wind until about 3 P.M. when with a west wind we sailed

            – making 3 miles, we suppose we are about 15 miles south of Wasta. A radiant night!</p></div>

            lying where we were last night with high south wind blowing. If it had not been so cold
            last night, I should have thought a khamseen coming for it has been thick and hazy all
            day – the sun a pale round orb disappearing early in an atmosphere laden with dust and
            sand. We have been trying to put the boat into festive Xmas attire with the very poor
            things we could find at a garden near here. The little salon now looks gay with bunches
            of rosemary in masses over sideboard and pictures, making a pleasant atmosphere – and

            even walking has been disagreeable – sand flying etc. We laid all the time just opposite
            the Beni Hassan hills, with the tombs plainly in sight – and the afternoon sun falling
            softly upon them made them seem a splendid resting place. <persName ref= "#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName>, with the

            shifting to the west, made it possible to sail, as there was a favorable bend in the

            when the wind became so strong, we had to bring up near the town which lies almost on
            the site of the old town built by Hadrian in memory of Antinous. A lovely place it was,
            amidst its lovely palms. I did not walk with the rest to see the few scant ruins of the
            ancient town – for the wind was so strong and cold, and the dust and sand flying in such
            blinding fashion. Everything inside and out was covered with it. We got away this

            were bowling along in splendid fashion, until we approached the difficult Abu Fêda
            cliffs – where the great bends in the river make such difficult sailing when the wind
            became fitful – coming in dangerous gusts – followed by <pb n="010"/> almost dead calms – even
            drawing ahead. The situation further complicated by many gyasses, made it so exciting,
            that we feel quite worn out this evening. The Beduin behaved splendidly, and our men
            were enthusiastic. We are now lying opposite <placeName ref="Manfalût">Manfalût</placeName>, where we hope to get some coal or

            One of the most beautiful sunsets it was ever vouchsafed to man to see – beginning with

            the lately quarried rocks into glaring and painful contrast, and more painful still were
            the transformed shores of the river along the cataract. Their beautiful isolation, and
            quiet loveliness, now broken with the sounds of blasting – the raw surfaces of the newly

            mountain peaks, and the evidences everywhere of proplonged water action – and everything
            partly submerged in yellow, pink sand drifts – no birds to be seen – many fine dome like
            sycamores, and the finest tamarasks I have ever seen – the foliage so thick and brightly
            green. We have made 40 miles. We drew up to what is an entirely new quarter of <placeName ref="Halfa">Halfa</placeName>,
            called Tewfikyia – good European houses, new and clean – a fine modern mosque, bazaar,
            Greek shops, etc. All our people chose to go to the 2d cataract this afternoon, instead
            of waiting for the regular excursion in the morning. The wind was strong and cold, and
            sand flying in clouds. They took one of the large sail boats, and with the Reis of the
            steamer and several of the sailors started, not returning until we had nearly finished
            dinner. They reported that they were not only able to sail up to the rock of Abusir, but
            3 miles beyond. I spent a quiet, nice afternoon with <persName ref="#Parsons_Lellie">Mrs. Parsons</persName> – the whole boat
            enveloped in canvass, to protect us from the wind and sand. However the little open
            space in the center of the steamer, which really serves us as drawing room, was very
            comfortable. It is where afternoon tea is served, and coffee. This evening we took

            quarters and barracks – we saw the hospital, and a company of conscripts just arrived –
            and dervishes working in chains. They were not permitted to show “Mamoud” whom we would
            like to have seen – saw an interesting collection of dervish arms etc. – at the doctor’s
            quarters – and a lovely little gazelle wandering about among the palms of the little
            enclosure. A very dusty ride of 2 miles or more to <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Salah’s</persName> house – which we found
            greatly improved since our last visit. We were shown into a large room well lighted with
            good windows – nice rugs on the floor, and divan – and tea waiting for us – with good
            china etc. The old mother, supposed to be over 90, and quite blind, was led in by <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Salah</persName>
            – and then he brought his pretty wife <persName ref="#Tamai">Tamai</persName>, with a clean and very pretty baby in her
            arms, who was frightened into tears at the sight of such fearsome white beings as we
            were. <persName ref="#Tamai">Tamai</persName> has grown a trifle stouter since I saw her 7 years ago – was well, even
            richly dressed. She evidently hated to have us look at her baby. Home by one o’clock,
            and off immediately for <placeName ref="#Abu Simbel">Abu Simbel</placeName>, reaching here at 4:30. We went to the temples at
            once. <name typle="boat" ref="Thames">“Thames”</name> lying <pb n="023"/> here – and post boat stopped to allow her few passengers to

            interesting from its inscriptions which of course we could not read. The most typical

            these people had served as officers servants during the late campaign, and of course had
            possessed themselves of many trophies – which they held at enormous prices. I saw one

            pilgrims, home from their wanderings. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bess</persName> crossed the river to <placeName ref="Asswan">Asswan</placeName>,

            pulled up to a low sand bank in the river, and lying quite out in the water – without a
            visible human being near us. I would always like to lie in such a spot – it is an ideal
            place to stop at – the river itself so wide here, and the desert on each side wider
            still. We are about two miles from <placeName ref="Silsilis">Silsilis</placeName> – I stayed on deck until 10 minutes of

            upon us, and for an hour or more the heat was great, 78 on my balcony. A beautiful

			<p><title>Luxor,

            It is so pleasant here – so many interesting things to do, and people to see. We have
            had 9 days here. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> has had <persName ref="#Huhat_Mr">Mr. Huhatt</persName> almost every day to lunch – and to play
            chess – I have crossed the river 3 times and had that charming ride, on my best of
            little donkeys, Yankee Doodle Plymouth Rock! First, <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName> and I went to
            <placeName ref="Gurnah">Gurnah</placeName>, to call on <persName ref="#Newberry">Mr. Newberry</persName> whom we found at home. <persName ref="#Spencers_The">Earl Spencer and his wife</persName> were
            making him a visit and after they went away we looked at many of the beautiful things
            belonging to <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr. Newberry</persName>. All the things found in their excavations were packed and
            most of them on their way to the Museum. We had tea, and then he and <persName ref="#Spiegelberg_Professor">Prof. Spiegelberg</persName>
            who has been working with him all the winter showed us one of the tombs they had opened,
            called the Gardeners Tomb, with very beautiful decorations in painting – the colours
            bright as new. The tomb was just below the house of the Sheik which they have been
            living in all winter. <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr. Newberry</persName> asked us to go with him to some of the private tombs,
            I had never seen – and the following Sunday morning <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName> and I went over
            after breakfast – charming morning. The ride along the high canal embankment is now
            rather disagreeable, as hundreds of workmen are busy digging out the silt, left from
            last years inundation. In this way this great embankment grows higher and wider every
            year. The sun proved very hot while we were clambering over and down the rough desert of
            that ancient necropolis, with its yawning pits. We went first to one that had been
            delicately beautiful in its low relief. <pb n="029"/>  It is now inhabited by fellaheen, and
            the sculptures are almost entirely buried in debris. Then to the tomb of Nekht – then to
            one of Rekh-ma-ra, who was Governor of Thebes, and died in the reign of Amenhotep II.
            This tomb with its elaborate sculptures and paintings, <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr. Newberry</persName> is doing for
            publication, and we must have it when it comes out. It was delightful to have <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr.
            Newberry</persName> show it to us, which he did con amore – with every explanation. It was after 12
            when we said goodbye to him, he having promised to come to dinner with us the next
            night. We found him more interesting than we thought – knows everybody and everything –
            began life as a scientific botanist under Sir Joseph Hooker – and we fraternised at once
            over our mutual tastes in gardening and architecture. Then we met <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Mr. Howard Carter</persName> –
            who has been doing such beautiful work at Der el Bahri, for so long. He also came to
            dine, and we went over and had tea with him the afternoon before we came away – and I
            chose the subjects of two sketches he is to make for me – Queen Aahmes – and Queen
            Sensenet, Mother of Thothmes I. <persName ref="#Buxtons_The">The Buxtons</persName>, who are on the Nepthys, and whom we met at
            Aswân, taking tea with us one afternoon, told us that <persName ref="#Buxtons_The">Mrs. Buxton’s</persName> (Gurney)
            grandfather’s gamekeeper, was this young <persName ref="#Carter_Howard">Carter’s</persName> father, and that he had great talent
            (the father) in drawing animals. An interesting history – we came very near stumbling
            upon the <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke_Duchess">Duke and Duchess of Connaught</persName> one afternoon as we went to pay a visit to <persName ref="#Buxtons_the">the
            Buxtons</persName>. They asked us to come again a little later, as the <persName ref="#Connaught_Duke_Duchess">Duke</persName> had sent word that they
            were coming to have tea with them – so we refrained from entering the boat. <name type="boat" ref="The_Nephtys">The Nephtys</name>,
            <name type="boat" ref="Thames">Thames</name> and <name type="boat" ref="Istar">Istar</name> all came down the same day. Poor <persName ref="#Sayce_Archibald">Mr. Sayce</persName> is again in great suffering

            yesterday – he was in bed – but called to me to come and speak to him. It really seems
            very serious. We have made the acquaintance of <persName ref="#Murch_Chauncey">Mr. Chauncey Murch</persName>, the head of the
            American Mission here at Luxor. He has been 15 years in <placeName ref="Egypt">Egypt</placeName> – and is a native of Ohio

            beautiful collection of scarabs I have ever seen – and of small objects. Our old friend
            <persName ref="#Mohassib_Mohammed">Mohammed Mohassib</persName> has had some very interesting things. Among others some pre-historic

            my cabana, and looked at the white heat that pervaded the world. Across the water at the
            edge of a broad stretch of sand, were two large groups of native men, engaged in some
            disputation. I took my glass and watched them – and could not but admire their gestures
            and bearing – in spite of their heavy, trailing garments of black and dark brown, which
            looked so inappropriate – and, as they in the heat of argument threw their white scarfs
            off, and again on, they might have served as studies to a school of acting. At last they
            separated, going their ways across the burning sand, striding along, one after the
            other. The country is full of poppy fields in bloom – such pretty pictures they make
            along the bank. </p></div><pb n="034"/>

            on our way home. Alas! owing to some disease last year, they have all been shorn of

            have been left everywhere as they fell from the trees, and are now quite withered and

			<p><title>Wednesday, March 22.</title></p> <p>We all went over early to the Museum this
            morning – and how pleasant it was to see it all again. The new finds are enormously
            interesting. One of the most remarkable is a statue of bronze, heroic size, found at Kom
            el-Ahmar, opposite El Kab, by <persName ref="#Quibell_Mr">Mr. Quibell</persName> – with a smaller statue near it of the same

            found at the same place, and above all a large slate, from the same place, and with the
            name of a king preceeding Mena – a most remarkable piece. We spent a long time among all
            the beautiful little objects up stairs – and I <pb n="038"/> looked at the mummy of the
            beautiful Nefertari and fancied I could trace lines of beauty in the shrunken black face
            – and wondered why she was not laid beside her victorious and famous husband Aahmes, the
            first king of the 18th dynasty. We met <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr. Newberry</persName> there, and he showed us such
            interesting things – and he introduced <persName ref="#Quibell_Mr">Mr. Quibell</persName>, and also <persName ref="#Bissing_Baron_von">Baron von Bissing</persName>, a very
            clever young scholar who is working at the Museum. <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I drove in the afternoon and
            we had a charming evening with <persName ref="#Newberry_Mr">Mr. Newberry</persName> – and we talked Egypt and things Egyptian

            of Amenophis III which was found last year by <persName ref="#Loret_M">M. Loret</persName> of the Museum. Such wonderful
            blue glazes – and such exquisite work! In the afternoon <persName ref="Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName> and I drove out almost to
            the Pyramids. It was tremendously hot – and a high wind blowing as it has blown for
            days. One of our horses soon after we turned to come home, had the blind staggers – <persName ref="#Buttles_Mary">Mary</persName>
            and I easily stepped out of the Victoria, the coachman and <persName ref="#Mohammed_Salah">Salah</persName> sprang from the box –
            but these people are so unready and helpless in an emergency – they could not relieve
            the poor animal of the harness – a mounted gens d’armes fortunately arrived, and gave
            <pb n="039"/> what help he could – the horse at last struggled on his feet, and then began the
            wildest scene, the poor beast crazed, kicked everything to pieces, overturned the nice
            carriage, which by great exertion on the part of <persName ref="#Mohammed_Salah">Salah</persName> and the coachman was just saved
            as it was going over the embankment – the dash board, dashes, lamps were smashed – the
            pole broken in 3 pieces – the harness a wreck. The other horse behaved most beautifully
            and intelligently – as quiet as possible, and showed such concern for the sick one, that
            it was quite touching. Everyone who passed offered assistance, but we sent to the Mena
            House for another carriage, and arrived at home a few minutes before dinner.</p></div>

            There is no one I so enjoy going to a gallery with. Some very remarkable and beautiful

            see a lovely medallion of Madonna and Child by Mino da Fiesole, that <persName ref="#Berenson_Bernard">Berenson</persName> had told

            the country - it is necessary to be very quiet about it, as its history is so peculiar
            and interesting. It came from the unimportant church of St. Bridget in <placeName ref="Rome">Rome</placeName> only a short
            time since. <persName ref="#Constantine">Constantine</persName>, prowling <pb n="047"/> about some months ago for treasures came upon
            this church and persuaded the sacristan or priest to allow him to have a copy made to
            replace the original - it was done, the Mino gave place to the copy, the church received
            the money, and the precious Mino goes to America to take her place in our hall, and to
            administer to us daily some of the sweet peace and pure beauty of that XVth century art.
            A young man, the son of <persName ref="#Constantine">Constantine</persName>, who lived some time in <placeName ref="New York">New York</placeName>, and was a clerk at
            Tiffany’s and who speaks excellent English told <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> that he was going over to
            America next month and would take in the medallion and charge himself with all
            responsibility and trouble. So, on the strength of this, we bought several things -
            chairs, stuffs etc. - so that they might all go over together. Then we prowled into some
            other shops, and bought a little exquisitely painted portrait, probably French. In the
            afternoon I and <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName> went for <persName ref="#Buttles_Lizzie">Lizzie</persName>, and the girls and we went to <persName ref="#Ryerson_Mrs">Mrs. Ryerson’s</persName>

            I am on the lookout for two or three marbles for the garden. <persName ref="Castello_Mrs">Mrs. Costello</persName> came to tea.
            It seems there is a very choice and modest little shop in <placeName ref="London">London</placeName> known as Toplady’s

            - <persName ref="#Pearsall-Smith_Mr">Mr. Pearsall-Smith</persName> suggests that the firm should be called, “Hohenloke, Hapsburg,
            Smith” (the Fieldings being descendants of the Hapsburgs). It seems that there is a
            combination of Hotels and several large dealers in antiquities known as the ___________,
            and they attempt to crowd out smaller dealers, and those who will not enter this
            combination. The porters of the hotels, the gondoliers, the guides all direct you to

            hall running straight through the building - said to be the 2d finest hall in <placeName ref+"Venice">Venice</placeName>,
            with fine rooms opening on either side. The palace fronts the Canal - but has gardens on
            both sides, and such a big garden behind that it is like a farm. Here <pb n="032"/> <persName ref="#Bensons_the">Mrs.
            Benson</persName> spends her days - digging, planting, caring for her precious flowers. <persName ref="#Bensons_the">Mr. Benson</persName>
            who is a very mediocre artist, has very good taste and having lived 15 years in this
            palace, has collected many beautiful and rare things - making a charming tout-ensemble.
            It is a strange history as told us by <persName ref="#Castello_Mrs">Mrs. Costello</persName>. <persName ref="#Bensons_the">Mrs. Benson</persName>, of French extraction
            was the only child of very strict and religious parents from whose rigidity when she
            came of age she much revolted. She married, had one son, and one daughter. Then met <persName ref="#Bensons_the">Mr.
            Benson</persName> who was a Baptist clergyman of artistic proclivities. They became violently
            attached and eloped, - the son remained with the father, the daughter went with the
            mother. After some time the original husband died, and <persName ref="Bensons_the">Mr. and Mrs. Benson</persName> married. They
            are now in reduced circumstances - the daughter chiefly supporting them. She is a writer
            of some reputation made her first success with “Kismet” a story of the Nile. <persName ref="Bensons_the">Mrs. Benson</persName>
            is said to have been very beautiful - one would not now think it - she is infirm and
            crippled from rheumatism, and was run over by a carriage sometime since, and almost
            killed - one eye being entirely destroyed. It was piteous to see these two old people (
            for the daughter we did not see ) devotedly attached to each other, amongst their
            beautiful things, so shut away from the world, and striving to keep their heads above
            water. <persName ref="Castello_Mrs">Mrs. Costello</persName> had told <persName ref="Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> that <persName ref="Bensons_the">Benson</persName> would occasionally sell some of his
            possessions, when he was pressed for the necessities of life - and that some of his
            friends would occasionally buy one of his <pb n="053"/> pictures, only for the sake of putting
            a little money in his pocket. So after the poor man had tried to sell us one of his

            to see a beautiful Madonna by Negro Ponte a Paduan painter - and a Madonna, child and
            angels by Bellini - the light so bad it could not well be seen. Then to the church of S.
            Maria Mater Domini and saw the beautiful Catena of St. Catherine and Angels, - exquisite

            Poldi-Pezzoli. It is much improved - many changes have been made - and a new catalogue

            by clouds. I have been in the house nursing a cold. <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName> took a steamer

            standing at the big window in our charming salon, looking out upon the lake, on whose
            shores we are. What an entourage is this of Lucerne! The steamers leaving now and then
            their widening ripple across the blue water - and the green hills, so dark on this
            sombre day, with their bright patches of tender young foliage - and the myriads of
            blossoming trees which stand about everywhere. A yellow billed black bird has been
            sitting at intervals all this afternoon on a slender tree outside my window - and making
            such delicious, penetrating music! We start at 7 A.M. tomorrow for <placeName ref="Paris">Paris</placeName> - which means

			<p><title>Liphook. Hampshire. Royal Anchor Hotel. May 20.</title></p> <p>Could not go out of the
            house until yesterday afternoon - Thursday I spent in bed. Came down here at 11:30 -
            Heavy showers alternating with bursts of sunshine all morning. But since lunch there has
            been nothing to do but to stay in our little sitting room, and watch the rain pouring
            against the window panes. We all had a <pb n="058"/> most cordial invitation to go down to <persName ref="#Farrar_William_Sir">Sir

            here. The rooms are clean and comfortable and have not been “lain” in, as often as those
            in the older part of the house. A lovely country, famous for its views, and fine, dry
            air, - but we could see nothing as yet - except dissolving views of the garden, and the
            fine trees about the house.</p></div>

			<p><title>Whit. Sunday, May 21.</title></p> <p>A gray and lowering morning dawned -
            but we had the courage to start at 10:30 for a drive. We had a very comfortable landau,
            two good horses - a stout and careful coachman - and we soon began to make acquaintance
            with this beautiful country - at first through characteristic English lanes - splendid
            hedges of hawthorn and holly - with towering oaks, beeches and larches - then out upon
            the moors, covered with gorse in full bloom - with the dark pines beyond, and the
            somber, stormy sky, making such ravishing effects of light, shade and colour - and such
            delicious air! it was a rapture to breathe. We went through Woolmer <pb n="059"/> Forest, and
            home again across the moor, in time for lunch at 1:30. Then a rest until 3 o’clock - and
            out again for Selborne - to see the old home of <persName ref="#White_Gilbert">Gilbert White</persName> - again the lovely lanes -
            the moor - up hill and down dales - exclaiming at the splendid oaks and beeches - the
            great stretches of valley, the picturesque cottages - the handsome estates, until in an
            hour and a half we entered the little village of Selborne, the quaintest and most
            delightful thing I ever saw. The strange timbered houses, with a peculiar use of
            different coloured bricks, and the thatched roofs, made me long for some sunlight to
            photograph them. We stopped at a little Inn to rest the horses and had a very good cup
            of tea, and then walked down the street to see the house of <persName ref="#White_Gilbert">Gilbert White</persName>, which I
            thought I knew from the prints of it - all of which it seems were taken from the garden
            side which we could not see - its back is almost upon the street. Then we walked a few
            steps to the old church, and into its churchyard, with lovely views across the valley -
            a glorious chestnut - and a wonderful old yew - some of the grave stones so eaten with
            age and lichens, that no trace of name or inscription remained. “The rude forefathers of
            the hamlet” or whoever they were, had indeed passed into oblivion. Coming home, the rain
            poured in torrents - and we had to have the carriage closed. Tonight, the whole world is
            shrowded in a heavy Scotch mist. I have a pleasant little room in a corner of the house,
            with two windows, and a tiny grate in which I have a little fire every night. It looks
            out on the little irregular square before the hotel, made by the crossing of two
            streets, and in this square stands the biggest and finest white <pb n="060"/> horse chestnut I
            have ever seen, now laden with bloom, and looking like some great chandelier, holding up
            its lights to heaven.</p></div>

			<p><title>Monday, May 22.</title></p> <p>We have had another day of driving in this
            delicious neighborhood, from whose height we saw the world all around us, or would have
            done so, had not a blinding rain swept through the valley, - but it was soon over and we
            drove home with the carriage open. Then this afternoon we drove four miles over to
            <placeName ref="Hashmere">Hashmere</placeName>, to see <persName ref="#Pearsall-Smith_Mr">Mr. Pearsall-Smith</persName> and have tea with him. We went through the beautiful

            and photographed a wonderful shire horse - the biggest thing in the way of a horse I

            which he has made delightful and very much occupied with his pretty garden. Just after

            now shining superbly. Never have I heard such a riotous chant of birds, as we hear here

            one hears from all sides accounts of that disaster. We have a charming suite of deck
            rooms - and I have a private bathroom opening from my room!</p></div>

			<p><title>Thursday, June 1st.</title></p> <p>The fog
            whistle has been going since early last evening - a melancholy music it is - the fog
            very thick - last night there was ice near us, and we stopped twice for a few moments.
            Half speed almost the whole time since the fog began, and that means a late arrival on
            Saturday, instead of an early one. I have spent all my time in my pretty big room - and
            two days I stayed in bed, getting a good rest. There has been no incentive to get up and
            go out as there has been cloudy, damp, rainy weather until the fog came - I have read
            Miss <pb n="064"/> Jekyls’s delightful “Wood and Garden”, a fascinating sea narrative, “The
            Cruiser of the Cachalot for Sperm Whales”. “Pages from a Private Diary” and
            Baring-Gould’s rather stuffed and padded “Old English Home”. I am now rereading
            Trollope’s admirable “Phineas Redeux”. But how long the hours are, and how blessed is
            the thought of home growing nearer and nearer!</p></div>

			<p><title>Sunday, June 4th. Holland House. New
            York.</title></p> <p>We reached our dock yesterday at one o’clock. Very good time considering the fogs
            we encountered during the last two days and nights. <persName ref="#Doty_Dr">Dr. Doty</persName> came on board to see us at
            Quarantine. We found <persName ref="#Whaling_John">John</persName> and <persName ref="#Whaling_Ettie">Ettie Whaling</persName> waiting on the wharf - and were not detained
            long in the Custom House. Warm weather. <persName ref="#Medary_Sam">Sam Medary</persName> and <persName ref="#Louise">Louise</persName> came to see me in the
            evening - and <persName ref="#Rogers_Andrews">Andrews Rogers</persName> - very warm today. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> in the house with a very hoarse
            cold - and thoroughly tired out. Just as we reached the Holland House yesterday, <persName ref="#Jeannie">Jeannie</persName>
            and <persName ref="#Convers_Mr">Mr. Convere</persName> turned up - and we had a long visit from them. <persName ref="#Daniel_Jones">Jones</persName> went to <placeName ref="Newport">Newport</placeName> on
            the evening boat yesterday - and the dogs must be happy. <persName ref="#Whaling_Ettie">Ettie</persName>, <persName ref="#Daniel_Jones">John</persName> and <persName ref="#Whaling_Bessie">Bessie</persName> left at
            one o’clock for the West - the poor things will suffer from the heat. We hope to get off
            on tomorrow nights boat.</p></div> 11 </body>
